    <p>Add webhook to Gitee repos of choice. You must have adminstrator access to use this feature.</p>
    
    <p>Make sure your <b>Gitee Connection</b> is set properly, and your <b>root URL</b>
    is set to something other than localhost or 127.0.0.1.</p>

    <p>If you are configuring a project for the first time and it is not working, make sure
    to save the project with your <b>Gitee Connection</b> saved, or you will run into errors.</p>

    <p>When you have set up the configuration, hit the <i>Connect Webhook</i> button. The request
    will succeed if the webhook is created, or the webhook exists already.</p>

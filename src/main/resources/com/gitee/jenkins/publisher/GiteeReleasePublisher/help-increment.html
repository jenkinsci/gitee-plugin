<div>
    <p>
        Increment version tag. If the latest version tag is in a format of ints you can increment specific version numbers.
    </p>

    <p>
        Use <b>[0 | + | =]</b> chars to set incrementing. <b>0</b> will that version number the same. <b>+</b> will increment that version number.
        <b>=</b> will set the number equal to what is was before.  
    </p>

    <p>
        <i>Example:</i> If a latest tag is 1.1.1, and the increment string is set to =.0.+, then the new incremented tag will be 1.0.2
    </p>

    <p>
        If a tag is not matched using the increment feature, the build will fail.
    </p>
